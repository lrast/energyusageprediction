# Kaggle project: Enefit - Predict Energy Behavior of Prosumers

## Problem Summary

We have data on the electricity production and consumption patterns from a number of energy 'prosumers' (clients that are both producers and consumers of electricity) with solar panel installations. 
Using this historical data, and historical weather, weather forecasts, and electricity and gas prices, the objective is to predict electricity production and consumption patterns for upcoming months.
